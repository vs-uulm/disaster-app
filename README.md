disasterApp
===========
A prototypical triage management system based on commodity hardware and software components using a single-hop, ad-hoc network architecture with multi-master replication, a tablet-based device setup, and a mobile application for emergency services.

Dependencies
------------
 * [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/)
 * [CouchApp](https://github.com/couchapp/couchapp)
 * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

Getting Started
---------------

### disasterApp
 1. Ensure that all dependencies are installed and available in your PATH
 1. Change to the `disasterApp` directory
 1. Run `npm install` to install all client dependencies with npm
 1. Run `gulp dist` to pack all client dependencies together
 1. Modify the `.couchapprc` according to your CouchDB configuration
 1. Run `npm run deploy` to push the application to your CouchDB instance
 1. Access the disasterApp using the displayed URL

### disasterBeacon
Due to an unresolved Erlang bug (see [Connection to IPv6 link local address fails due to missing scope identifier](http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-bugs/2010-October/002065.html)) it is not possible to replicate to a remote database using an IPv6 link local address.
As a workaround Erlang's native IP implementation can be patched, by modifying the `inet_set_address` method in `otp/erts/emulator/drivers/common/inet_drv.c`.
This method is used to set the ip address for a connection.
To use link local addresses one has to set the `sin6_scope_id` field in the `sockaddr` struct, to the correct value.
Since this value is only used for link local addresses, any other communication is unaffected by this workaround.
(see also [man 7 ipv6](http://linux.die.net/man/7/ipv6))

 1. Make sure that couchDB listens on all IPv6 addresses, by setting `chttpd.bind_address = ::`
 1. Change to the `disasterBeacon` directory
 1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies with npm
 1. Start the disasterBeacon with `node index.js` or any node process manager (e.g. pm2)

Deploying disasterApp on a Raspberry Pi
---------------------------------------

 1. Attach two WLAN USB dongles to the Raspberry Pi
 1. Configure one as an access point (e.g. using [hostapd](https://w1.fi/hostapd/)), through which a user device can be connected
 1. Configure the other one in IBSS mode
 1. Install all dependencies and follow the "Getting Started" instructions
